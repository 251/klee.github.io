## Mailing Lists

Currently the main list for KLEE discussion (both for users and developers) is [klee-dev]({{site.baseurl}}/klee-dev).

Commit messages to the KLEE repository go to [klee-commits](https://mailman.ic.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/klee-commits).

## Bug Reports

If you find a bug in KLEE, please fill a bug report on [GitHub](https://github.com/ccadar/klee/issues/new). You might also want to report it on [klee-dev]({{site.baseurl}}/klee-dev).

## Working with the Code

You should first check [KLEE's developer's guide]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/developers-guide).

Developer documentation is written in [Doxygen](http://klee.github.io/klee/).

Many parts of KLEE rely on the LLVM infrastructure, so you might also want to look at [LLVM's General Programming Documentation](http://llvm.org/docs/#llvmprog).
