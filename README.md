# KLEE Official Website

The KLEE website, built using [Web Starter Kit](http://developers.google.com/web/starter-kit) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

## Quickstart

You should have a reasonably recent version of Ruby (use [RVM](http://rvm.io/) or [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) to get one) and [Bundler](http://bundler.io/).

Clone this repository and install all dependencies using:

```bash
$ bundle
```

Then, you can preview the site by running (at `localhost:4000` by default):

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve -w
```

To build the site, you can use:

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll build
```
